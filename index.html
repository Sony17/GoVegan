    <h2>Go Vegan for Animals and the Planet, Too and  <span class="text-accent">we want you</span> to join the team</h2>
    <p>Every piece of food we eat makes its own impact on the environment. But, some foods make much more of an impact than others. The production of meat takes a huge toll on our planet. Breeding, raising, and slaughtering billions of animals for food every year requires massive amounts of natural resources, like fresh water and land, and generates massive amounts of waste and pollution. Simply put, our appetite for meat—and the factory farming system that feeds it—is unsustainable.

      But we don’t have to rely on unsustainable factory farms to feed us. This is where veganism comes in. By eliminating our consumption of animal products and making the switch to plant-based eating, we can stop the rapid depletion of Earth’s resources, slow the threat of climate change, and help protect our planet for generations to come.</p>

        <h3>Veganism reduces greenhouse gas emissions</h3>
        <p>What we eat is one of the biggest contributors to our individual carbon footprint, and going vegan can ease our diet’s burden on the planet.
          This drastic reduction is due to the fact that every step of the production process for animal products like beef and dairy generates greenhouse gases: from the clearing of forests to make way for animal pasture, to the production of millions of tons of animal feed, to the immense waste generated by cows, pigs, chickens, and other farm animals. 

Overall, the process of raising and killing animals for meat is much more carbon-intensive than just growing and harvesting plants for food</p>

          <h3>A vegan diet reduces energy consumption</h3>
        <p>Animal waste is not the only source of dangerous emissions in the meat industry. Our food system relies on energy from fossil fuels to grow, prepare, and transport food. Globally, burning fossil fuels is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 25% of emissions worldwide.

          Meat requires a lot of processing before it is suitable for human consumption, and meat processing requires a lot of energy. It takes about 31.5 kilowatt-hours of energy to produce one pound of beef—a little under the amount of energy your fridge uses to run for a whole month. Plant-based sources of protein, like beans and nuts, require much less processing and are therefore much more energy-efficient than meat. Making the switch to plant-based saves energy consumption and reduces fossil fuel emissions..</p>

          <h3>Go Vegan for Animals and the Planet, Too</h3>
        <p>We all need access to clean, drinkable water to survive as a species. When we consume fresh water at a faster rate than its supply can naturally replenish, we risk disrupting the water cycle, which could lead to long periods of drought and global water shortages. If we don’t change our water consumption habits and reduce our water footprint, the UN estimates that 700 million people could face "intense water scarcity" by 2030—less than a decade from now.</p>
